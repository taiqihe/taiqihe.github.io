    abstract = "How can large language models (LLMs) process and translate endangered languages? Many languages lack a large corpus to train a decent LLM; therefore existing LLMs rarely perform well in unseen, endangered languages. On the contrary, we observe that 2000 endangered languages, though without a large corpus, have a grammar book or a dictionary. We propose LingoLLM, a training-free approach to enable an LLM to process unseen languages that hardly occur in its pre-training. Our key insight is to demonstrate linguistic knowledge of an unseen language in an LLM{'}s prompt, including a dictionary, a grammar book, and morphologically analyzed input text. We implement LingoLLM on top of two models, GPT-4 and Mixtral, and evaluate their performance on 5 tasks across 8 endangered or low-resource languages. Our results show that LingoLLM elevates translation capability from GPT-4{'}s 0 to 10.5 BLEU for 10 language directions. Our findings demonstrate the tremendous value of linguistic knowledge in the age of LLMs for endangered languages. Our data, code, and model generations will be released to the public. Our data, code, and model generations can be found at \url{https://github.com/LLiLab/llm4endangeredlang}.",

IGT typically consists of (1) transcriptions, (2) morphological segmentation, (3) glosses, and (4) free translations to a majority language. We propose Wav2Gloss: a task in which these four annotation components are extracted automatically from speech, and introduce the first dataset to this end, Fieldwork: a corpus of speech with all these annotations, derived from the work of field linguists, covering 37 languages, with standard formatting, and train/dev/test splits. We provide various baselines to lay the groundwork for future research on IGT generation from speech, such as end-to-end versus cascaded, monolingual versus multilingual, and single-task versus multi-task approaches.",

For data augmentation, we explore two approaches: creating artificial data from the provided training data and utilizing existing IGT resources in other languages. On the modeling side, we test an enhanced version of the provided token classification baseline as well as a pretrained multilingual seq2seq model. Additionally, we apply post-correction using a dictionary for Gitksan, the language with the smallest amount of data. We find that our token classification models are the best performing, with the highest word-level accuracy for Arapaho and highest morpheme-level accuracy for Gitksan out of all submissions. We also show that data augmentation is an effective strategy, though applying artificial data pretraining has very different effects across both models tested.",

abstract = {Natural language processing models based on machine learning (ML-NLP models) have been developed to solve practical problems, such as interpreting an Internet search query. These models are not intended to reflect human language comprehension mechanisms, and the word representations used by ML-NLP models and human brains might therefore be quite different. However, because ML-NLP models are trained with the same kinds of inputs that humans must process, and they must solve many of the same computational problems as the human brain, ML-NLP models and human brains may end up with similar word representations. To distinguish between these hypotheses, we used representational similarity analysis to compare the representational geometry of word representations in two ML-NLP models with the representational geometry of the human brain, as indexed with event-related potentials (ERPs). Participants listened to stories while the electroencephalogram was recorded. We extracted averaged ERPs for each of the 100 words that occurred most frequently in the stories, and we calculated the similarity of the neural response for each pair of words. We compared this 100 Ã— 100 similarity matrix to the 100 Ã— 100 similarity matrix for the word pairs according to two ML-NLP models. We found significant representational similarity between the neural data and each ML-NLP model, beginning within 250 ms of word onset. These results indicate that ML-NLP systems that are designed to solve practical technology problems have a representational geometry that is correlated with that of the human brain, presumably because both are influenced by the structural properties and statistics of language.},
