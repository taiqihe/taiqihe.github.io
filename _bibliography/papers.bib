    abstract = "Interlinear glossing provides a vital type of morphosyntactic annotation, both for linguists and language revitalists, and numerous conventions exist for representing it formally and computationally. Some of these formats are human readable; others are machine readable. Some are easy to edit with general-purpose tools. Few represent non-concatentative processes like infixation, reduplication, mutation, truncation, and tonal overwriting in a consistent and formally rigorous way (on par with affixation). We propose an annotation convention{\^a}€{''}Generalized Glossing Guidelines (GGG) that combines all of these positive properties using an Item-and-Process (IP) framework. We describe the format, demonstrate its linguistic adequacy, and compare it with two other interlinear glossed text annotation schemes.",

    abstract = "In our submission to the SIGMORPHON 2023 Shared Task on interlinear glossing (IGT), we explore approaches to data augmentation and modeling across seven low-resource languages. For data augmentation, we explore two approaches: creating artificial data from the provided training data and utilizing existing IGT resources in other languages. On the modeling side, we test an enhanced version of the provided token classification baseline as well as a pretrained multilingual seq2seq model. Additionally, we apply post-correction using a dictionary for Gitksan, the language with the smallest amount of data. We find that our token classification models are the best performing, with the highest word-level accuracy for Arapaho and highest morpheme-level accuracy for Gitksan out of all submissions. We also show that data augmentation is an effective strategy, though applying artificial data pretraining has very different effects across both models tested.",

abstract = {Natural language processing models based on machine learning (ML-NLP models) have been developed to solve practical problems, such as interpreting an Internet search query. These models are not intended to reflect human language comprehension mechanisms, and the word representations used by ML-NLP models and human brains might therefore be quite different. However, because ML-NLP models are trained with the same kinds of inputs that humans must process, and they must solve many of the same computational problems as the human brain, ML-NLP models and human brains may end up with similar word representations. To distinguish between these hypotheses, we used representational similarity analysis to compare the representational geometry of word representations in two ML-NLP models with the representational geometry of the human brain, as indexed with event-related potentials (ERPs). Participants listened to stories while the electroencephalogram was recorded. We extracted averaged ERPs for each of the 100 words that occurred most frequently in the stories, and we calculated the similarity of the neural response for each pair of words. We compared this 100 × 100 similarity matrix to the 100 × 100 similarity matrix for the word pairs according to two ML-NLP models. We found significant representational similarity between the neural data and each ML-NLP model, beginning within 250 ms of word onset. These results indicate that ML-NLP systems that are designed to solve practical technology problems have a representational geometry that is correlated with that of the human brain, presumably because both are influenced by the structural properties and statistics of language.},
