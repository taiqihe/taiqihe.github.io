I have a Masters degree from [Language Technologies Institute](https://lti.cs.cmu.edu/), advised by Lori Levin. Previously I worked with [Randy O'Reilly](https://ccnlab.org/). I got my bachelor's degree from UC Davis, with theses advised by [Steve Luck](https://lucklab.ucdavis.edu/) and [Kenji Sagae](http://compling.ucdavis.edu/sagae/).

My research interests are in speech recognition, language documentation, and langauge technologies for indigenous languages.
